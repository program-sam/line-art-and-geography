# What Do You Get When You Combine Line Art, Javascript and Geography?

Dust off your JavaScript because a new weekend project is here! After playing for a while with heightmaps, Javascript, Leaflet and the P5 library, this is what I ended up with. 'Funky' lines to play with. Now all that's left for this project is finding a way to make it useful. What are your ideas? What would you do differently? How would you use this?

## How to use

Simply download the repository and open the html file in your browser. All dependancies (Leaflet, P5 and P5 scribble) are included in the repository.
