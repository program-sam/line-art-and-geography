# What Do You Get When You Combine Line Art, Javascript and Geography?

Dust off your JavaScript because a new weekend project is here! After playing for a while with heightmaps, Javascript, Leaflet and the P5 library, this is what I ended up with. 'Funky' lines to play with. Now all that's left for this project is finding a way to make it useful. What are your ideas? What would you do differently? How would you use this?

## How to use

Simply download the repository and open the html file in your browser. All dependancies (Leaflet, P5 and P5 scribble) are included in the repository.

If you like this project and foud this repository useful, consider buying me a coffee ðŸ’ª.
